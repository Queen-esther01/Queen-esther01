## About Me
Hello &#128075; My name is Esther Ejidike. Frontend Engineer with 4 years of experience, Nigerian ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ - born & raised. I speak English, just enough Igbo to make you think I'm really good at it, and I am interested in learning a new language but not motivated enough. &#128517;

I currently work as a software engineer @ [Norebase](https://norebase.com) &#128171; where we help companies and individuals alike scale across Africa. If you are ever interested in starting a company anywhere in the world, we can help you! You can call here [+1 360-295-2698](tel:+13602952698) or here [+234-80-3977-7385](tel:2348039777385) or email at [hello@norebase.com](mailto:hello@norebase.com)

At Norebase, I work on a myriad of internal & external web applications, add new features to products, build brand new products, write tests, maintain codebases, monitor applications using Sentry/Azure App insights, fix & assign bugs and so much more.

I have extensive experience in building products from scratch as a part of a team and as a single individual. I enjoy working on anything visually engaging/appealing, working in unknown technical domains & discovering new things, building new products, writing e2e tests, working on browser automation apps, and designing. I also like AR/VR and I hope to perhaps work in that field someday. &#128526;
